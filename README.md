### Hey there! I’m [Ike Steoger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikesteoger/), a full stack JavaScript developer looking to continue expanding my coding skills!

- I am currently searching to transition to a career in technology after 10+ years in customer service.
- I have experience with JavaScript, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, Node.js, React, React Native, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Web Sockets, and AWS.
- I’m currently learning Python, expanding my knowledge on Google API usage, and seek to learn more about game engines such as Godot Engine and GameMaker Studio!
- I’m interested in playing (and making) video games, riding bikes, and throwing a round of disc golf with friends!
- I’m looking to collaborate on learning opportunities! If you have a JavaScript project that needs a hand, I would love to help!
- You can reach out to me on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikesteoger/) or search Ike Steoger!
